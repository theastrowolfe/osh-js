How To Download
===


### Releases

Binary and Source distributions archives can be downloaded directly from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-js/releases) of our GitHub account.

The release contains a vendor directory (needed for some pre-coded views), the minified osh-js library and its corresponding stylesheet.
You can use both the all-in-one vendor minified script(vendor.js & vendor.css) or the separate ones. 

See the [Install Section](install.md) for instructions on how to set it up on your device.
